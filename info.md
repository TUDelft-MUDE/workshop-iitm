MUDE in Madras is course for civil engineers and geoscientists that focuses not only on theory, but also using computation to solve real world problems. This page introduces the key components of the course.

## Online Resources

There are several online resources for this module, most of which are available with a quick-link in the top right corner of this website:
- **MUDE Online Textbook**: weekly reading, along with interactive exercises to practice and study the material. 
- **Files Page**: key files for easy access. Notebook files (`*.ipynb`) will be converted to HTML for easy online viewing; however the complete set of files required for an assignment (e.g., `*.py` or data files) will only be available via GitLab.
- **GitHub**: this our primary platform for sharing and submitting assignments, as well as receiving feedback. You will need a GitHub account. Links will be provided for the assignments via this website.

## Assessment

Your total MUDE grade consists of three assessments:	
- Exam at end of Q1 (resit in Q2) (25%)
- Exam at end of Q2 (resit in Q3) (25%)
- Assignment Portfolio (50%)

You will pass the module if you obtained at least a 5.8 for the three individual components.

## Assignments

There are three types of assignments every week, each of which is described below:
- **Programming Assignments (PA)**: individual, part of Assignment Portfolio grade.
- **Workshops (WS)**: assigned and completed during Wednesday sessions. _Not_ part of Assignment Portfolio grade.
- **Group Assignments (GA)**: completed in groups during Friday sessions. Part of Assignment Portfolio grade.

## Weekly Schedule

Each week begins with a lecture on Monday and ends with a Group Assignment completed in-class on a Friday; question hours, Programming Assignments and Wednesday Workshops are designed to help you learn the topic for each week in a structured way that is repeated each week.

### In-Class Sessions

The in-class sessions on Wednesday and Friday are designed for you to work collaboratively with classmates and be able to easily ask questions to teachers. We will be distributed over multiple locations, with instructors in each room. Room assignments will be posted to this website each week, by group number. You are not required to work with your group during the Wednesday sessions, although it is a useful moment to reflect on the Group Assignment from the previous week and plan for the upcoming Friday. Attendance is required for the Friday sessions.
