Our first in-class workshop activity is next Wednesday, November 27. In order to get off to a smooth start, we ask that you come prepared, which requires two things:
1. Software installed on your laptop
2. Reading from the textbook, completed in advance (2 chapters: theory and programming)
3. Completing a small Programming Assignment (PA) 

If you have not already done so, read through the course information page.

Our first topic is related to numerical analysis and will involve a simple exercise focused on numerical integration. [Chapter 1 in the Theory section of the book](https://tudelft-mude.github.io/workshop-iitm-book/main/numerical_methods/overview.html){:target="_blank"} introduces the topic.

The [first Programming chapter in the book](https://tudelft-mude.github.io/workshop-iitm-book/main/programming/week_1_1.html){:target="_blank"} will guide you through the software installation required to participate in the workshop. 

Once you have completed the software installation, you can start the first Programming Assignment (PA), which should be completed before the first in-class session. The assignment can be accessed via this link: [classroom.github.com/a/S1jsupjT](https://classroom.github.com/a/S1jsupjT){:target="_blank"}; detailed instructions are provided in the README. Note: you will need to create a GitHub account to accept the assignment, if you do not already have one!

The last page of the programming chapter includes an interactive page to help you understand a few Python fundamentals. If you have never used a Jupyter Notebook before, contact the course instructors. [Videos like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suAkMeWJ1yE) can help you get started using notebooks in VS Code.

We look forward to seeing you in class on Wednesday!
